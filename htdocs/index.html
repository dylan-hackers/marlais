Marlais is an interactor for the Dylan Programming Language (more information
is available on Dylan at <A HREF="http://www.fun-o.com">Functional Objects,
Inc.</A> and at the <A HREF="http://www.gwydiondylan.org">Gwydion Dylan
Maintainers' Website</A>).
<P>
Marlais was first developed by <A HREF="mailto://brent.benson@oracle.com">
Brent Benson</A>.  Then,
<A HREF="mailto://jnw@cis.ufl.edu">Dr. Wilson</A> took up development with
others and hosts Marlais up to version 0.5.12
<A HREF="http://www.cis.ufl.edu/~jnw/Marlais">at this web site</A>.  
<A HREF="mailto://dauclair@hotmail.com">Douglas M. Auclair</A> now heads 
this project, and maintains a page on Dylan at 
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/dylan_programmer">geocities</A>.
<P>
<H3>The Plan</H3>
Marlais is in great shape ... it can load in and interpret Dylan files, and
it can start and interactive session from scratch.  It is, however, based on
a Dylan spec of 6 years ago, so this project will bring Marlais up to speed
in the following ways:
<OL>
 <LI> First, we'll fix any inconsistancies of the functions defined in the
      <A HREF="http://www.gwydiondylan.org/drm/drm_96.htm#HEADING96-0">Dylan 
      Reference Manual (DRM), chapter 12</A>.
      Actually, this task isn't so herculean, as most of the function and
      class bindings are correct, see <A HREF="bindings.html">the bindings
      list</A> for what needs to be done.</LI>
 <LI> Next, we'll implement as much as the common-dylan spec described in the
      <A HREF="http://www.fun-o.com/products/doc/core/index.htm">Common Dylan
      and Functional Extensions Reference</A></LI>
 <LI> Finally, we'll implement the 
      <A HREF="http://www.gwydiondylan.org/drm/drm_76.htm#HEADING76-0">hygenic 
      macro system</A>, and then, reimplement the basic "syntax" using macros
      and in accordance with 
      <A HREF="http://www.gwydiondylan.org/drm/drm_110.htm#HEADING110-0">chapter
      14 of the DRM</A>.</LI>
</OL>
The above listed items are what I see as priorities.  After that, we'll take on
other Marlais issues as they occur to the group.

<TABLE BORDER="0">
<TR><TD VALIGN="top"><A NAME="io-beta">August 29, 2001</A></TD>
<TD>I've completed a beta of the Common-Dylan specification's IO library
    (well, it <EM>works</EM>.  It's not a library <EM>per se</EM> (as Marlais 
    doesn't support libraries yet) but a collection of modules).
<TR><TD VALIGN="top"><A NAME="mac-port">August 27, 2001</A></TD>
<TD>Jaime E. Vargas ported Marlais to Mac OS-X.  There were a couple of
    tweeks needed (specifically number.c, error.c, and Makefile, all of which
    can be obtained from the CVS source tree) that make the call for a
    configure file a bit more urgent.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="top"><A NAME="release_0_6_4">August 24, 2001</A></TD>
<TD>Released Marlais 0.6.4.  This release fixes the issue between
    DEFINE-CONSTANT forms and the top-level-values binding mechanism.  Did
    some code cleanup as well (removed more classic syntax code and some
    factored out code for defining methods).</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="top"><A NAME="release_0_6_3">August 23, 2001</A></TD>
<TD>Released Marlais 0.6.3 -- a bug-fix for concatenate that affected lists
    and strings (which, accidentally, affected format and friends).  Also, 
    added some new command-line switches -- -h for help, -e to execute Dylan
    expressions, and -v to print version number.  Eliminated quit and bye
    in favor of EOF or BRK exits by the user (to assist CGI programming,
    file scripts and -e evals automatically exit unless the user uses -s
    (stay) that keeps the interactor running).</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="top"><A NAME="release_0_6_2">August 22, 2001</A></TD>
<TD>Released Marlais 0.6.2 -- this release no longer includes the Boehm
GC but does have instructions on how to get it.  This release includes
closer conformance to the DRM, reduced/refactored source code, and better
top-level bindings.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="top"><A NAME="no classic">August 21, 2001</A></TD>
<TD>Marlais used to support the "classic syntax" (a la Scheme).  I eliminated
    the code that supported it, as DRM-compliant Dylan no longer allows that.
    Also fixed the <A HREF="#const">multiple-return-value issue</A>, but still
    must fix the constant bindings of constants.  This should not be too 
    difficult, given DEFINE-CONSTANT is not supposed to return values.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="top"><A NAME="binding">August 20, 2001</A></TD><TD>Did a 
comparison study of Marlais' Dylan module binding to that required by the DRM.
Happily, Marlais is pretty close to the standard.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="top"><A NAME="release_0_6_1">July 6, 2001</A></TD><TD>Release Marlais 0.6.1 -- added parsing for Windows '\r' characters, integrated Boehm 5.3 GC, and Andreas's constants work.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="top"><A NAME="const">July 3, 2001</A></TD><TD>Andreas Bogk added a first go of top-level enumerated constants of returned values.  "Normal" returned values are bound properly.  What needs work is how <EM>user</EM> constant definitions are bound and that multiply-returned values are bound to multiple constants.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="top"><A NAME="gc">June 28, 2001</A></TD><TD>Downloaded the 
latest Boehm GC and installed
on my local copy of marlais.  I'll do a new release once I tag the old sources
and upload the new gc sources.</TD></TR>

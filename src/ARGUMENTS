marlais [-b] [-d] [-n] [init-file ...]

marlais is the Marlais Dylan(TM) interpreter.  It directly evaluates
programs written in a variant of Apple Computer's Dylan programming
language.  Marlais supports both the infix syntax defined in the Dylan
Reference Manual[1], and the prefix syntax of the Dylan book[2].

Each of the specified init-files must contain infix Dylan code to be
evaluated before the interpreter begins its read-eval-print loop.
If errors occur during load of the init-files, the interpreter will
terminate its execution.

Switches:

	-b	Show the banner (with the version number) at startup.

	-d	Generate parser debug output.

	-n	Suppress loading the system default Dylan init file.

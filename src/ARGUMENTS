marlais [-dhnsv] [-e '<Dylan expression>'|init-file ...]

marlais is the Marlais Dylan(TM) interpreter.  It directly evaluates
programs written in a variant of Apple Computer's Dylan programming
language.

Each of the specified init-files must contain infix Dylan code to be
evaluated before the interpreter begins its read-eval-print loop.
If errors occur during load of the init-files, the interpreter will
terminate its execution.

Switches:

  -d	Generate parser debug output.
  -e    Executes a Dylan expression, prints resulting value, then exits.
  -h    Prints help menu.
  -n	Suppress loading the system default Dylan init file.
  -s    Stay in the interactor after executing an expression or file.
  -v    Prints version number.

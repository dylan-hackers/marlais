I flew solo for the 0.6.2 and 0.6.3 distributions.

Acknowledgments for the 0.6.1 distribution:

Thanks to:

Dr. Joe Wilson for allowing me to pick up on this project and leaving Marlais
in a very strong state.

Andreas Bogk for adding top-level bindings for return values.

Hans Boehm for making his garbage collector so easy to integrate -- right out
of the box!

--------------------------------------------

Acknowledgments for the 0.5.12 distribution:

Thanks to:

Ron Franke-Polz pointed out problems with handling of white space.

Marty Hall for the lcm and gcd code in init.dyl.

I fixed make for generic functions to work in the face of method
caching, fixed `for' to exit with non-false values rather than only on
#t, modified apply_print to work when trace_functions is in effect,
fixed bug in bind-exit that would cause incorrect behavior when
exit-proc was passed as first argument to a method.

Acknowledgments for the 0.5.11 distribution:

Thanks to:

Luc Beaudoin <L.P.Beaudoin@cs.bham.ac.uk> for finding a big bug in
array indexing.

Patrick Beard <pcbeard@llnl.gov> for as (<small-integer>, <string>),
for a fix to the array indexing bug, various compatibility fixes, a
fix to prefix read of numberings (allowing leading `.'), for making
sure as (<class>, <collection>) got fixed, and for string-size-setter.

Johan Dahl for his helpful bug reports concerning coercions and
formatting.

Bruce Hoult <Bruce@hoult.actrix.gen.nz> for pointing out the lack of a
working shallow-copy on arrays and for encouraging the object-print
mod.

I added support for `block' (fixing unwind-protect in the process),
added object-print (to allow user-defined functions to affect the
listener print method), repaired method caching, and updated arrays
use to use element, element-setter, and shallow-copy in compliance
with the DIRM.

Acknowledgments for the 0.5.10 distribution:

The method caching code was written by Drew Nolan (wan@cis.ufl.edu).
I wrote the L*Loops class precedence list calculation.

Most of the other items are as in version 0.5.9.

Acknowledgments for the 0.5.9 distribution:

As of revision 0.5.9, the Marlais interpreter is copyrighted under the
GNU Library General Public License.  Thus, it is now certifiably free
software.  My thanks to all who have helped with its development.

Ramin Zabih (rdz@cs.cornell.edu) is using MacMarlais as the
programming language vehicle for CS 212 "Modes of Algorithmic
Expression," which you can read about at the following URL:

	http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Courses/Current/CS212/CS212.html

The use of the interpreter in that course has been the cause for many
improvements to the implementation.

I realize I've left contributions of some out, but here are the names
of many who have helped with Marlais since 0.5:

Bob Alexander (bob_alexander@ccmail.com provided many improvements to
init.dyl.

Tom Arns toma@hal.com for help with linux porting.

Patrick Beard (beard@llnl.gov) made many more improvements to the mac
interface (which are not seen in the unix distribution), provided much
help in translating init.dyl to infix, in making setters DIRM
compliant, , pointed out problem with array iteration protocol,
provided devalue_args, pointed out a problem with +-sign prefixed
literal numbers, gave me lots of diffs to match his <big-integer>
extensions provided in MacMarlais, fixed map-into, and drastically
improved the tracking of line numbers for error reporting.  Perhaps
most importantly, he also made the tail call optimization mods.

Brent Benson (bwb@icad.com) provided aint and anint for systems not
having them and helped with porting.

Roger Critchlow (rec@arris.com) was quite helpful in providing
solutions to header parsing using start contexts with flex.  Patrick

Johan Dahl (Johan.Dahl@ling.lu.se) pointed out a problem and fix for
`any?' in init.dyl, pointed out problem with negative number literals,
and reminded us that errors always appeared to be on line #1.  He also
pointed out problems with the list literals.

Dave Dyer (ddyer@pak.triple-i.com) gave some sgi porting help,
pointed out a fix for a problem with infix_decode_token,
contributed subsequence-position

Hugh Emberson (hugh@cosc.canterbury.ac.nz) for a bit of linux help.

Adi Fairbank (anf1@rsrch1.cit.cornell.edu) helped with porting to
_HP_UX.

Seth LaForge <sethml@ugcs.caltech.edu> for some help with hpux porting.

Drew Nolan (wan@cis.ufl.edu) provided create_generic parameters, &
sub_specializers, fixed a problem with multiple values return parsing,
pointed out lots of problems with init.dyl, provided fix for
function-specializers.

Robert Orenstein (rlo@netcom.com) found that a bug allowing methods
with non-congruent parameter lists to be added to generic functions.
This bug was fixed by Drew Nolan.

P. Tucker Withington (ptw@harlequin.com) provided the definition of
replace-subsequence!.

Michael Wolber (wolber@informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de) found an error in
member?(<object>, <list>).

The responsibility for all errors is, of course mine.

Acknowledgments for the 0.5 distribution:

More thanks are necessary to Patrick Beard for helpful fixes and suggestions
and for his work on the Mac version.
Brent helped with configuration checking.
Randy Fischer helped with Linux configuration checking.
Thanks to Steve Strassmann for pointing out several blatantly obvious errors
just before release.


Most of all, though, thanks to you for reading the acknowledgments and
sharing some of your time to make this product useful.

Acknowledgments for the 0.4 distribution.

The Marlais interpreter was started as a quick implementation by Brent
Benson (Brent.Benson@mail.csd.harris.com), who wanted an
implementation of Dylan to experiment with.  The first version was
churned out in a short period of time (weeks) by Brent.

I first happened upon Marlais in Version 0.3 (Nov. 1993).  I wanted to
use it as a language vehicle for a small portion of a course in
Object-Oriented Programming I taught in the spring of 1994 at the
University of Florida.  I realized there were some limitations to the
system, but that Marlais was very accessible and modifiable.  I hacked
in the features that I wanted to use, but then got interested in the
language in a more serious way.

I embarked on systematically adding Dylan Design Note changes in about
May of 1994.  I contacted Brent and told him about my efforts.  I said
I'd be glad to produce a Version 0.4 of the interpreter.  Brent said
he was glad to have someone breathe new life into the project.  Later
in the month, Patrick Beard (beard@cs.ucdavis.edu) started contributing
numerous suggestions and corrections (esp. w.r.t. porting to Mac) that I
incorporated into the current Marlais version.  Brent and
Bri Carlstrom (bdc@ai.mit.edu) also provided helpful porting feedback.

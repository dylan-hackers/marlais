Marlais is a simple-minded interpreter for a programming language
strongly resembling Dylan [1].  It is not intended as a final release,
but rather to fill a perceived void where Dylan implementations are
concerned.  This is a "hackers release" and is intended as a vehicle
for education, experimentation and also to encourage people to port it
to different architectures, add features, and fix bugs.  Marlais is
alpha software and should not be used by people desiring
reliability!!!

Marlais information and distributions are available via the web from

	http://www.cis.ufl.edu/~jnw/Marlais/

or for anonymous ftp from

	ftp://ftp.cis.ufl.edu:/pub/src/Marlais


***NOTE***
The interpreter will read, evaluate, and print a sequence of semicolon
terminated Dylan expressions.

The normal interpreter prompt is the symbol `?'.
If an incomplete expression has been entered, the interpreter prints
a continuation prompt `>'.

If you type a non-semicolon terminated expression at the interpreter,
you will see the continuation prompt.  This is your cue to finish up
with a semicolon.  Here's an example:

	? 1 + 3
	> ;
	4

This release contains marlais.el, an emacs mode (based on comint.el)
suitable for use as a listener for the marlais interpreter.  It
requires dylan-mode.el, the most recent version of which may be
obtained via World-Wide Web from URL
	http://legend.gwydion.cs.cmu.edu:8001/gwydion/mindy/dylan-mode.el
It also contains dylan-hilit19.el, which contains a dylan mode pattern
for emacs hilit19.

Marlais is a simple-minded interpreter for a programming language
strongly resembling Dylan [1].  It is not intended as a final release,
but rather to fill a perceived void where Dylan implementations are
concerned.  This is a "hackers release" and is intended as a vehicle
for education, experimentation and also to encourage people to port it
to different architectures, add features, and fix bugs.  Marlais is
beta software and should not be used by people desiring reliability!

Marlais information is available at:

	http://marlais.sourceforge.net

and distributions are available via the web from

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/marlais

This release of Marlais uses the Boehm garbage collector, version 5.3.
Source code for it is available at

	http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc


***NOTE***
The interpreter will read, evaluate, and print a sequence of semicolon
terminated Dylan expressions.  It will do so until it evaluates the
expression "quit();", "bye();" or EOF character (CRTL-D for Unix and
CRTL-Z for Windows).

The normal interpreter prompt is the symbol `?'.
If an incomplete expression has been entered, the interpreter prints
a continuation prompt `>'.

If you type a non-semicolon terminated expression at the interpreter,
you will see the continuation prompt.  This is your cue to finish up
with a semicolon.  Here's an example:

	? 1 + 3
	> ;
	4

Marlais Dylan
=============

The Marlais Dylan interpreter is a straightforward implementation of a programming language strongly resembling Dylan, an object-oriented dynamic language. It is copylefted software that was originally developed by Brent Benson of Harris Computer Systems. Further development was done by the Dylan Hackers.

This repository is an archive of that work, with some enhancements to make it build once more.

Currently not fully working.
